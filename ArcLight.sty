ELECTRIC-ARC LAMP.
SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 335,787, dated February 9, 1888.
Application filed July 13, 1885.
To aZZ whom, it may concern:
Be it known that I, NIKOLATESLA, of Smilj an Lika, border country of Austria-Hungary, have invented certain Improvements in Electrio-Arc Lamps, of which the following is a specification.
In another application, No. 160,574, filed by me March 30, 1885, I have shown and described a lamp having two magnets, in the IO main and shunt circuits, respectively, an armature-lever, and feed-mechanism connected to the armature-lever.
M ypresent invention consists in some modifications of and improvements upon the do- I 5 vices shown in the application referred to.
In my present invention I further provide means for automatically withdrawing a lamp from the circuit, or cutting out the same, when, from afailure of the feed, the arc reaches an abnormal length, and also means for automatically reinserting such lamp in the circuit when the rod drops and the carbons come into contact.
My invention will be understood with refer- 2 ence to the accompanying drawings.
In the drawings, Figure 1 is an elevation of the lamp with the case in section. Fig. 2 is a sectional plan at the line 00 m. Fig. 3 is an elevation, partly in section, of the lamp at 0 right angles to Fig. 1. Fig. 4 is a sectional plan at the line 3 y of Fig. 1. Fig. 5 is asection of the clamp in about full size. Fig. 6 is a detached section illustrating the connection of the spring to the lever that carries the piv- 5 ots of the clamp, and Fig. 7 is a diagram showing the circuit-connections of the lamp.
In the drawings, Fig. 1, M represents the main and N the shunt magnet, both securely fastened to the base A, which, with its side oolumns,S S, is preferably cast in one piece of brass or other diamagnetie material. To the magnets are soldered or otherwise fastened the brass washers or disks a a a a. Similar washers, b b, of fiber or other insulating material,
.5 serve to insulate the wires from the brass washers.
The magnets MI and N are made very flat, so that their width exceeds three times their thickness, or even more. In this way a comparatively small number of eonvolutions is Serial No. 171,416. (No model.)
sufficient to produce the required magnetism, besides a greater surface is offered for cooling off the wires.
The upper pole-pieces, m n, of the magnets are curved, as indicated in the drawings, Fig. 1. The lower pole-pieces, m n, are brought near together, tapering toward the armature g, as shown in Figs. 2 and 4. The object of this taper is to concentrate the greatest amount of the developed magnetism upon the armature, and also to allow the pull to be exerted always upon the middle of the armature g. This armature g is a piece of iron in the shape of a hollow cylinder, having on each side a segment cut away, the width of which is equal to 6 5 the width of the pole-pieces m n.
The armature is soldered or otherwise fastened to the clamp 0', which is formed of a brass tube, provided with gripping-jaws e c, Fig. 5. These jaws are arcs of a circle of the diameter of the rod 1%, and are made of some hard metal, preferably of hardened German silver. I also make the guides f f, through which the carbon-holding rod R slides, of the same material. This has the advantage to reduce greatly the wear and corrosion of the parts coming in frictional contact with the rod, which frequently causes trouble. The jaws e e are fastened to the inside of the tube 1', so that one is a little lower than the other. The object of this is to provide a greater opening for the passage of the red when the same is released by the clamp. The clamp r is supported on bearings 20 20, Figs. 1, 3 and 5, which are just in the middle between the jaws c e. I find this disposition to be the best. The bearings w w are carried by a lever, I, one end of which rests upon an adjustable support, q, of the side columns, S, the other end being o0nnected by means of the link (2 to the armaturelever L. The armature-lever L is a hat piece of iron in Z shape, having its ends curved so as to correspond to the form of the upper polepieces of the magnets M and N. It is hung upon the pivots e c, Fig. 2, which are in the jaw 00 of the top plate, 13. This plate B, with the jaw, is preferably cast in one piece and screwed to the side columns, S S, that extend up from the base A. To partly balance the overweight of the moving parts a spring, .9, I00
Figs. 2 and 6, is fastened to the top plate, B, and hooked to the lever 15. I The hook 0 is toward one side of the lever or bent a little sidewise, as seen in Fig. 6. By this means a slight tendency is given to swing the armature toward the pole-piece m of the main magnet.
The binding posts K K are preferably screwed to the base A. Amanual switch, for short-circuiting the lamp when the carbons are renewed, is also to be fastened to the base. This switch is of ordinary character, and is not shown in the drawings. I
Therod R is electrically connected to the lamp-frame by means of a flexible "conductor or otherwise. The lamp-case receives a removable ornamental cover, 8 around the sa me to inclose the parts.
The electrical connections are as indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 7.
The wire in the main magnet consists of two parts, :17 and 1). These two parts may be in two separated coils or in one single helix, as shown in the drawings. The part as being normallyin circuit, is, with the fine wire upon the shuntmagnet, wound and traversed by the current in the same direction, so as to tend to produce similar poles, n n or s s, on the corresponding pole-pieces of the magnets M and N. The part 19 is only in circuit when the lamp is cut out, and then the current beingin the opposite direction produces in the main magnet magnetism of the opposite polarity.
The operation is as follows: At the start the carbons are to be in contact, and the current passes from the positive binding-post K to the lamp-frame, carbon-holder, upper and lower carbon, insulated return-wire in one of the side rods, and from there through the part .00 of the wire on the main magnet to the negative binding-post. Upon the passage of the current the main magnet is energized and attracts the clamping-armature g, swinging the clamp and gripping the rod by means of the grippingjaws e 6. At the same time the armature-lever L is pulled down and the can bons separated. In pulling down the armature'lever L the main magnet is assisted by the shunt-magnet N, the latter being mag netized by magnetic induction from the mag- .net M.
It will be seen that the armatures L and g are practically the keepers for the magnetsM and N, and owing to this fact both magnets with either one of the armatures Land 9 may be considered as one horseshoe-magnet,which we might term a compound magnet. The whole of the soft-iron parts m, m, g, a, n, and L form a compound magnet.
The carbons being separated, the fine wire receives a portion of the current. Now, the
- magneticinduction from themagnet M is such as to produce opposite poles on the corresponding ends of the magnet N; but the current traversing the helices tends to produce similar poles on the corresponding ends of both magnets, and therefore as soon as the fine wire is traversed by sufficient current the magnetism of the whole compound magnet is diminished.
With regard to the armature g and the operation of the lamp, the pole in may be termed as the clamping and the pole n as the releasing pole.
As the carbons burn away, the fine wire receives more current and the magnetism diminishes in proportion. This causes the armature-lever L to swing and the armature g to descend gradually under the weight of the a moving parts until the end 1), Fig. 1, strikes astop on the top plate, B. The adjustment is such that when this takes place the rod R is yet gripped securely by the jaws e e. The further downward movement of the armaturelever being prevented, the arc becomes longer as the carbons are consumed, and the compound magnet is weakened more and more until the clampingarmature g releases the hold of the grippingjaw's 66 upon the rod R, and the rod is allowed to drop a little, shortening thus the arc. The fine wire now receiving less current, the magnetism increases, and the rod is clamped again and slightly raised, if necessary. This clamping and releasing of the rod continues until the carbons are consumed. In practice the feed is so sensitive that for the greatest part of the time the movement ofthe'rod cannot be detected without some actual measurement. During the normal operation of the lamp the armaturelever L remains stationary, or nearly so, in the position shown in Fig. l.
Should it arise that, owing to an imperfection in the rod, the same and the carbons drop too far, so as to make the are too short, or even bring the carbons in contact, then a very small amount of current passes through the fine wire,
ly strong to act as on the start in pulling the armature-lever L down and separating the carbons to a greater distance.
It occurs often in practice that the rod sticks in the guides. In this case thearc reaches a great length, until it finally breaks. Then the light goes out. and frequently the fine wire is injured. To prevent such an accident, I provide my lamp with an automatic cutout. This cut-out operates as follows: When, upon a failure of the feed, the arc reaches a certain predetermined length, such an amount of current is diverted through the fine wire that the polarity of the compound magnet is reversed. The clamping-armature g is now moved against the shunt-magnet N until it strikes the releasing-pole a. As soon as the contact is established, the current passes from the positive binding-post over the clamp r, armature g, insulated shunt-magnet, and the helix 1) upon the main magnet M to the negative bindingpost. In this case the current passes in the and the compound magnet becomes sufl'icientopposite direction and changes the polarity of I 0 the magnet M, at the same time maintaining by magnetic induction in the core of shuntmagnet the required magnetism without reversal of polarity, and the armature 9 remains against the shunt-magnet pole n. The lamp is thus cut out as long as the carbons are separated. The cut-out may be used in this form without any further improvement; but I prefer to arrange it so that if the rod drops and the carbons come in contact the arc is started again. For this purpose I proportion the resistance of the part 1) and the number of the convolutions of the wire upon the main magnet so that when the carbons come in contact a sufficient amount ofcurrent is diverted through the carbons and the part 00 to destroy or neutralize the magnetism of the compound magnet. Then the armature 5;, having a slight tendency to approach to the clamping-pole m, comes out of contact with the releasingpole a. As soon as this happens, the current through the part 19 is interrupted, and the Whole current passes through the part :v. The magnet M is now strongly magnetized, the armature g is attracted, and the rod clamped. At the same time the armature-lever L is pulled down out of its normal position and the are started. In this way the lamp cuts itself out automatically when the arc gets so long, and reinserts itself automatically in the circuit if the carbons drop together.
It will be seen that the cut-out may be modi fied without departing from the spirit of my invention, as long as the shunt-magnet closes a circuit including a wire upon the main magnet and continues to keep the contact closed, being magnetized by magnetic induction from the main magnet. It is also obvious to say that the magnets and armatures may be of any desired shape.

The combination, in an arc-lamp, of a main and a shunt magnet, an armaturelever to draw the are, a clamp, and an armature to act upon the clamp, a clampingpole and a releasing-pole upon the respective cores, the cores, poles, armature-lever, and clampingarmature forminga compound electromagnet, substantially as set forth.
